In this react-native project, I developed a kind of mobile version of 'reactjs-foundations' to interact with the REST API from 'nodejs-foundations'. It uses native resources, hooks, and axios.

Instead of having exactly the same funcionalities of 'reactjs-foundations', here we focus on likes. Then, the following features have been implemented: **`repository listing`**, showing the number of likes for each one, and **`like repository`**, being able to give a like to a repository.
